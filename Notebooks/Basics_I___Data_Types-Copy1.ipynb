    "\n",
    "Now you can study operator precedence [here](https://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/op_precedence.html) _or_ you can use parenthesis just like in math: **statements inside parenthesis are grouped together and are evaluated before reducing the expression or concatenating the following operations**.\n",
